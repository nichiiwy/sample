Use Linux to complete the following exercises.

Create a directory named logs.
mkdir logs

Move the log output from the fixGenerator script into the logs directory. (Be sure the script has finished before doing this.)
mv fixlog20220726124943.log ./logs/

From the command line, replace all instances of MTHREE in the file with M3 and put the output into a new file named fixlog2.log in the logs directory.
sed 's/MTHREE/M3/' fixlog20220726124943.log > fixlog2.log

Run a command to pull all fill messages from fixlog2.log and put the output into a new logfile named fills.log. (You may need to look up how to tell if a message is a fill.)
grep "39=2" fixlog2.log > fills.log

Run a command to pull all cancel acknowledgement messages (39=4) from fixlog2.log into a new log named cancels.log in the same directory.
grep "39=4" fixlog2.log > cancels.log

Run a command to create a new log file named partialFills.log and add the partial fills from fills.log to the new file.
grep "39=1" fills.log > partialfills.log

Use awk to create a new file out of the partial fill log that has the following tags only: Symbol (55); orderID (11); side(54); fill price (31); fill quantity (32); execution id (17). Name the file parsedPartialFills.log and make sure you print the columns in the order listed here.
awk '/55 11 54 31 32 17/{print}' partialFills.log > parsedPartialFills.log

Using an editor, remove the first part of every fix tag (so you are left with the value only) and turn the file into a comma separated list with no spaces. This is how you might have to get a file ready to send to a trader.


In the file, add a row of column headers separated by commas. The headers should be Symbol, OrderID, Side, Price, Qty, and ExecID.
i 
Symbol,OrderID,Side,Price,Qty,ExecID

Save the file as .module10.csv in the location specified by your instructor.
cp parsedPartialFills.log parsedPartialFills.module10.csv

Make a copy of the cancels file and name it cancels2.log.
cp logs/cancels.log logs/cancels2.log

Open the cancels2.log file in an editor. Find the first symbol (tag 55) in the first line and add the letter A to the beginning of the value. (If it was 55=GOOG, it will become 55=AGOOG.)
vi logs/cancel2.log then :%s/55=GOOG/55=GOOGA/

Run a difference between the original cancels file and the new file you just edited.
diff cancels.log cancels2.log
