Create a simple shell script to tell the user about their session â€“ they need to know:

What their username is
yourusername()
> {
> logname
> }

What the current date is
date()
> {
> date +%Y.%m.%d
> }

What the time is
whatisthetime()
>{
> date +%Y.%m.%dT%T%Z
>}

What their current working directory is
currentdirectory()
> {
> pwd
> }


How many files they have in that directory
howmanyfiles()
> {
> ls | wc -l
> }

What is the biggest file in their current directory
biggestfile()
> {
> du -hsx * | sort -rh | head -1
> }



Activity 2
Create a directory with a few test files in it (the files can be empty). Now write a script that for every file in that directory you rename it to have an extension of today's date in YYYYMMDD format.
mkdir testfile
cd testfile
touch file1 file2 file3

DAY=$(date +%F)
for FILE in *.txt
 do
    mv $FILE ${DAY}-${FILE}
 done
