Activity 1
Given the list fruit_list, write a script that iterates through the list and prints each item on a separate line.

fruit_list = ["apple", "banana", "cherry", "gooseberry",
"kumquat", "orange", "pineapple"]


for i in fruit_list:
    print (i)
    
-----------


Activity 2
Write a Python script that asks the user for a string and displays the characters of the string to the user, with each character on a new line.

ans = str(input("Input a word: "))
for i in range(len(ans)):
    print (ans[i])

----------



Activity 3
Write a Python script that computes the length of a string without using the len() function.

ans = str(input("Input a word: "))
count = 0 
for i in ans:
    count +=1
print (count)

----------



Activity 4
Create a program that starts with a list of strings, identifies all the strings with more than two characters, stores the results in another list, and displays the new list.

a = ["a", "bc", "rye", "hello", "c", ""]
list = []
for x in a:
    if len(x) > 2:
        list.append(x)
print (list)

----------

Activity 5
Write two scripts, each of which displays all numbers divisible by 50 between 100 and 1000 (inclusive).

# script 1: range
for i in range(100,1001):
    if i % 50 == 0:
        print (i)
        
# script 2: while
count = 100
while count < 1001:
    if count % 50 == 0:
        print (count)        
        count += 1
    else: 
        count += 1



----------

Activity 6
Create a script that computes the sum of all numbers between 0 and 100.

sum = 0 
for i in range (0,101):
    sum += i 
print (sum)
----------

Activity 7
Create a script that computes the factorial of any given number.
n = int(input("Input a number: "))
fact = 1
for i in range(1,(n+1)):
    fact *= i
print (fact)
    
    ----------

Activity 8
Starting with the defined fruit_list in the code block below, update the script to perform the following tasks.

fruit_list = ["apple", "banana", "cherry", "gooseberry", "kumquat", "orange", "pineapple"]

new_name = ''
count = 0
while new_name != 'stop':
    new_name = input("Please enter a fruit, or enter 'quit': ")
    if new_name in fruit_list:
        for x in fruit_list:
            if new_name == x:
                count += 1
            else:
                count += 0
        print (count)



---------
Activity 9
Create a script that asks the user for a variable number of values and displays the sum of those values to the user. The program should prompt the user for values until the user enters the word "quit" (uppercase or lowercase), display the values used in the calculation, and then display the total of those values.


names = []

# Set new_name to something other than 'quit'.
new_name = ''

sum = 0

# Start a loop that will run until the user enters 'quit'.
while new_name != 'quit':
    new_name = input("Please enter a number, or enter 'quit': ")

    if new_name != 'quit':
        names.append(new_name)
        sum += int(new_name)
    

print(sum)

----------
Activity 10
Write a script that asks the user for an integer value and then displays the multiplication table of that input number from 1 through the integer squared.

choice = int(input("Enter an integer: "))
for i in range(1, ((choice)**2+1)):
    product = i * choice
    print ("The multiplication table is", (i), "x", (choice), "=", (product))
    
----------

Activity 11
Create a script that identifies all prime numbers between 0 and 100.

for Number in range (1, 101):
    count = 0
    for i in range(2, (Number//2 + 1)):
        if(Number % i == 0):
            count = count + 1
            break

    if (count == 0 and Number != 1):
        print(" %d" %Number, end = '  ')
-----------


Activity 12
Write a script that calculates the greatest common denominator between two numbers.
def gcd(a, b):
  
    # Everything divides 0
    if (a == 0):
        return b
    if (b == 0):
        return a
  
    # base case
    if (a == b):
        return a
  
    # a is greater
    if (a > b):
        return gcd(a-b, b)
    return gcd(a, b-a)

count4 = 0
count5 = 0 
count6 = 0

a=int(input("ENTER A FIRST NUMBER "))

b=int(input("ENTER THE SECOND NUMBER "))

c=a*b

for i in range(1,c+1):

        print ("THE LCM IS = ",i)
        break

Activity 15
Write a Python script that determines if an input number can be expressed as the sum of two prime numbers.


Number = int(input('Enter the Number : '))

arr = []

for i in range(2, Number):
    flag = 0
    for j in range(2, i):
        if i % j == 0:
            flag = 1
    if flag == 0:
        arr.append(i)

        
flag = 0
for i in range(len(arr)):
    for j in range(i + 1, len(arr)):

        if arr[i] + arr[j] == Number:
            flag = 1
            print(str(arr[i]) + " and " + str(arr[j]) + ' are prime numbers when added gives ' + str(Number))
            break
