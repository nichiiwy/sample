Write a script that meets the following requirements:

Add your name and the current date in comments at the top of the script.
Prompt the user to enter their first name, their last name, their phone number, and the year they were born. Save each of these values to a different variable.
Display the values they entered.
Test your script to make sure it works as expected.

fname = input(str("What is your first name: "))
lname = input(str("What is your last name: "))
pnum = int(input("Phone number: "))
year = int(input("What year were you born: "))

print ("Your name is", (fname), (lname), "Your phone number is", (pnum), "You were born in the year", year)
