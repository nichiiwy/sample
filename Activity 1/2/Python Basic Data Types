Activity 1:

integer = (input("Input a value"))
print (type(integer))
newint = int(integer)
print ("The value is", (integer), "with type integer")

Activity 2:
result = (5 + 3) ** 2 * 9 
print(result) # the output should be 576

Activity 3
Create a computer program that prompts the user for a float number and returns the integer portion of the floating number.

x = float(input("Input a number : "))
y = int(x)
print (y)

Activity 4
Write a computer program that calculates and displays the current value of a deposit for a given initial deposit, interest rate, how many times interest is calculated per year, and the number of years since the initial deposit.
The program should prompt the user for each of the values and use the following formula to calculate the current value of the deposit:

P = int(input("What is the intial Deposit : "))
r = float(input("What is the interest rate as a fraction : "))
n = int(input(What is the number of times per year the interest is calculated : "))
t = int(input("How many years since the initial deposit : "))
V = P(1 + r/n)^nt
print ("The current value of the deposit is", (V))

Activity 5
Write a computer program that prompts the user for a principal amount, the rate of interest, and the number of days for a loan and then calculates and returns the simple interest for the life of the loan. Use the formula:
principal = int(input("What is the principal amount : "))
rate = float(input("What is the rate of interest : "))
days = int(input("What is the number of days for a loan : "))
interest = principal * rate * days / 365
print ("The interest you will receive is", (interest))

Activity 6
Create a computer program that displays three statements that evaluate to True and three statements that evaluate to False.

a = 2
b = 1
a > b
b < a
b - a == -1

a < b
b > a
b - a == 1




Activity 7
Create a computer program that prompts the user for a number and calculates the following:

x = int(input("Select a number: "))
print ("Youve selected", (x) )

b = bool(x)
print ("The boolean of your number is", (b))

bi = bin(x)
print ("The binary equivalent is", (bi))

sr = x**(0.5)
print ("The square root is", (sr))



Activity 8

x = int(input("Select the first number: "))
y = int(input("Select a second number: "))
z = int(input("Select a third number: "))
w = int(input("Select a forth number: "))
v = int(input("Select a fifth number: "))

product = x*y*z*w*v
sum = x + y + z + w + v
average = (sum)/5

print ("you entered the values", (x), (y), (z), (w), (v),)
print ("The product is", (product), "The sum is", (sum), "The average is, (average)")


Activity 9

addnum = int(input("What is your house number: "))
street = str(input("What is the name of your street: "))
Type = str(input("What is the type of your street: "))

print ("Your full address is", (addnum), (street), (Type))
print ("Your house number is", (addnum))
print ("The street name is", (Type), (street))
