Instructions
Write a program that performs the following steps:

Ask the user for a number.
Output a count starting with 0.
Display the count number if it is not divisible by 3 or 5.
Replace every multiple of 3 with the word "fizz."
Replace every multiple of 5 with the word "buzz."
Replace multiples of both 3 and 5 with "fizz buzz."
Continue counting until the number of integers replaced with "fizz," "buzz," or "fizz buzz" reaches the input number.
The last output line should read "TRADITION!!"


n = int(input("Enter a number: "))
count = 0
print (count)
for i in range(1,n+1):
    if i % 15 == 0:
        print ("Fizz Buzz")
    elif i % 3 == 0:
        print ("Fizz")
    elif i % 5 == 0:
        print ("Buzz")
    else:
        print (i)
        

print ("Tradition!")
