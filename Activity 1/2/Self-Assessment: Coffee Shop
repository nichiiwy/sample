Write a program that will calculate the cost of a custom cup of coffee at a gourmet coffee shop, based on the size of the cup, the type of coffee selected, and flavors that can be added to the coffee. It should complete the following steps:

price = 0

size = str(input("Do you want small, medium, or large? "))
if size == "small":
    price += 2
elif size == "medium":
    price += 3
elif size == "large":
    price += 4
if coffee == "brewed":
    price += 0
elif coffee == "espresso":
    price += 0.5
elif coffee == "cold brew":
    price += 1
coffee = str(input("Do you want brewed, espresso, or cold press? "))
syrup = str(input("Do you want a flavored syrup? (Yes or No)"))
if syrup == "Yes":
    flavour = str(input("Do you want hazelnut, vanilla, or caramel? "))
    price += 0.5
    print ("You asked for a", (size), "of", (coffee), "with",(flavour),"syrup")
else:
    print ("You asked for a", (size), "of", (coffee), "with", "no syrup")



total = price*1.15
final = round (total, 2)

print ("Your cup of coffee costs", (price), "\n The price with a tip is" , (final))
