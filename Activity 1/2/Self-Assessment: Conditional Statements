Your company has organized a morale event! They're hosting a picnic and field day in the park, and of course, they want to play games! Team games! Team building games!

To do that they want to assign the attendees to certain teams based on their last name. They've already chosen the team names, but they want you to write a program that will sort each person into the correct team.


lastname = str(input("What's your name: "))

if lastname[0] == "A" or lastname[0] == "B" or lastname[0] == "C" or lastname[0] == "D":
    team = "Red Dragons"
elif lastname[0] == "E" or lastname[0] == "F" or lastname[0] == "G" or lastname[0] == "H":
    team = "Dark Wizards"
elif lastname[0] == "I" or lastname[0] == "J" or lastname[0] == "K" or lastname[0] == "L":
    team = "Moving Castles"
elif lastname[0] == "M" or lastname[0] == "N" or lastname[0] == "O" or lastname[0] == "P":
    team = "Golden"
elif lastname[0] == "T" or lastname[0] == "S" or lastname[0] == "R" or lastname[0] == "Q":
    team = "Night Guards"
else: 
    team = "Black Holes"

print ("What's your last name?", (lastname),"\n"
"Aha! You're on the team", (team), "!\nGood luck in the games!")
