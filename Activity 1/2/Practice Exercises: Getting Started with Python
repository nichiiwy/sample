Activity 1
Create a computer program that performs the following steps:

Prompt the user for an integer and store the value in a variable.
Display the data type of the variable that holds the entered data.
Convert the value to an integer type and store the converted value in a new variable.
Display the value and type of the new variable in a single sentence. (For example, "The value is 8 with type integer.")
Run the program and enter a float value at the prompt. What is its value in the last step?

x = (input("Input a value"))
datatype = type(x)
print (datatype)
newint = int(x)
print ("The value is", (x), "with type", (datatype00))


Activity 2
Write a computer program that calculates and displays the current value of a deposit for a given initial deposit, interest rate, how many times interest is calculated per year, and the number of years since the initial deposit.

The program should prompt the user for each of the values and use the following formula to calculate the current value of the deposit:

P = int(input("What is the intial Deposit : "))
r = float(input("What is the interest rate as a fraction : "))
n = int(input(What is the number of times per year the interest is calculated : "))
t = int(input("How many years since the initial deposit : "))
V = P(1 + r/n)^nt
print ("The current value of the deposit is", (V))



Activity 3
Write a computer program that prompts the user for a principal amount, the rate of interest, and the number of days for a loan and then calculates and returns the simple interest for the life of the loan. Use the formula:
principal = int(input("What is the principal amount : "))
rate = float(input("What is the rate of interest : "))
days = int(input("What is the number of days for a loan : "))
interest = principal * rate * days / 365
print ("The interest you will receive is", (interest))



Activity 4
Create a computer program that prompts the user for a purchase total and a sales tax rate and then returns the total price of the sale.
total = int(input("What is the purchase total?: "))
tax = float(input("What is the sales tax rate?: "))
price = total*( 1+ (tax))
print ("Your total price for the sale is", (price))


Activity 5
Create a computer program that displays three statements that evaluate to True and three statements that evaluate to False.

a = 2
b = 1
a > b
b < a
b - a == -1

a < b
b > a
b - a == 1


Activity 6
Write out the following program and run it using 4 as the first value and 10 as the second value.

first = int(input("Input a number: "))
second = int(input("Input another number: "))

if first > second:
    print((first), " is greater than " , (second))
elif first < second:
    print((second),  " is greater than " , (first))
else:
    print("They are the same number!")
Run it a few more times with other values to identify the problem and then fix the code so that it works as expected.

Activity 7
Create a computer program that completes the following tasks:

It prompts the user for a series of 5 integers.
The user must be prompted for 5 numbers.
After the fifth entry, the program stops prompting for values and performs the following calculations:
the product of the integers
the average of the integers
the sum of the integers
After performing the calculations, the program should display the following to the user:
the values the user entered
each of the calculations, using a phrase that identifies the value

---------

Activity 8
x = int(input("Select the first number: "))
y = int(input("Select a second number: "))
z = int(input("Select a third number: "))
w = int(input("Select a forth number: "))
v = int(input("Select a fifth number: "))

product = x*y*z*w*v
sum = x + y + z + w + v
average = (sum)/5

print ("you entered the values", (x), (y), (z), (w), (v),)
print ("The product is", (product), "The sum is", (sum), "The average is, (average)")

----------

Activity 9
Create a computer program that asks the user a few True/False statements to which the user will respond either True or False.

T = str(input("Oceans contain salt water"))
F = str(input("Sharks are mammals"))


if T == "True":
    print ("You answered", T, "which is the correct answer!")
else: 
    print ("You answered", T, "which is the wrong answer! The correct answer is True")
if F == "True" or F == "true":
    print ("You answered", F, "which is the wrong answer! The correct answer is False")
else: 
    print ("You answered", F, "which is the correct answer!")

-----------

Activity 10
Write a program that performs the following steps:

addnum = int(input("What is your house number: "))
street = str(input("What is the name of your street: "))
Type = str(input("What is the type of your street: "))

print ("Your full address is", (addnum), (street), (Type))
print ("Your house number is", (addnum))
print ("The street name is", (Type), (street))
